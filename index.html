    <h2>Sport</h2>
    <p>
      From 1999 to 2001, the Czech Republic won the World Championship three times in a row. Only Canada and the USSR 
      were able to achieve the “three-peat” before. The Czechs went on to win gold medals in 2005 and 2010, while the U20 
      team won the World Championship back-to-back in 2000 and 2001. It is one of the most successful national ice hockey 
      teams in history and a member of the so-called "Big Six," the unofficial group of the six strongest men's ice hockey nations.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Around the 4th century B.C., the present territory of the Czech Republic was populated by Celts. They were the
      first known ethnic group to arrive in the area, according to historical evidence. The Celtic Boii tribe gave the
      country its Latin name - Boiohaemum (Bohemia). They were replaced by the German tribes before the beginning of
      our era. The German tribes were present in the territory of Czech Lands till the beginning of the 6th century
      when they either left or merged with Slav tribes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 6th century, Slav tribes settled in the territory of the Czech
      Lands during the period known as the Migration of Peoples. The first half of the 7th century marks the first
      successful attempt to unite these tribes under a Frankish duke Samo. The so-called "Kingdom of Samo" (623 - 659)
      resisted the pressure of the powerful Avar empire centered in the current territory of Hungarian lowlands and
      defended its territory against the forces of the Franks from the west, with partial success.

    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <p>
      On Easter, families prepare painted eggs and feasts ready for Monday as the holiday comes to a close. On Easter
      Monday, the Czech people take part in 'pomlázka,' a tradition in which boys and men go from house to house gently
      whipping girls/women with traditional 'pomlázka' whips in an effort to chase away illness and negativity.

  <div id="orloj" class="content">
    <h2>Orloj</h2>
    <p>
      The Orloj is mounted on the southern wall of Old Town Hall in the Old Town Square. The clock mechanism has three 
      main components: the astronomical dial, representing the position of the Sun and Moon in the sky and displaying 
      various astronomical details; statues of various Catholic saints stand on either side of the clock; "The Walk of 
      the Apostles", an hourly show of moving Apostle figures and other sculptures, notably a figure of a skeleton 
      that represents Death, striking the time; and a calendar dial with medallions representing the months. 
      According to local legend, the city will suffer if the clock is neglected and its good operation is placed in jeopardy; 
      a ghost, mounted on the clock, was supposed to nod its head in confirmation. According to the legend, the only hope 
      was represented by a boy born on New Year's night.
