<h2>
History
</h2>
<p>
Around the 4th century B.C. the present territory of the Czech Republic was populated by Celts. They were the first known ethnic group to arrive in the area, according to historical evidence. The Celtic Boii tribe gave the country its Latin name - Boiohaemum (Bohemia). They were replaced by the German tribes before the beginning of our era. The German tribes were present in the territory of Czech Lands till the beginning of 6th century when they either left or merged with Slav tribes.

At the end of the 5th and the beginning of 6th century Slav tribes settled in the territory of the Czech Lands during the period known as the Migration of Peoples. The first half of the 7thcentury marks the first successful attempt to unite these tribes under a Frankish duke Samo. The so-called "Kingdom of Samo" (623 - 659) resisted the pressure of the powerful Avar empire centered in the current territory of Hungarian lowlands, and defended its territory against the forces of the Franks from the west, with partial success.
